		description: "God of War is an action-adventure game franchise created by David Jaffe at Sony's Santa Monica Studio. It began in 2005 on the PlayStation 2 (PS2) video game console, and has become a flagship title for the PlayStation brand, consisting of eight fully fledged games across multiple platforms, as well as a text-based game, with another full game to be released in November 2022. Based in ancient mythologies, the story follows the titular protagonist, Kratos, a Spartan warrior and later the Greek God of War, who was tricked into killing his family by his former master, the original Greek God of War Ares. This sets off a series of events that leads to wars with the different mythological pantheons. The Greek era of the series sees Kratos follow a path of vengeance due to the machinations of the Olympian gods, while the Norse era, which introduces his son Atreus as a secondary protagonist, shows an older Kratos on a path of redemption, which inadvertently brings the two into conflict with the Norse gods and the pair trying to prevent Ragnarök.'",
